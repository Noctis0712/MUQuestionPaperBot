# MUQuestionPaperBot
[![Telegram Bot](https://img.shields.io/badge/Telegram-Bot-green.svg)](https://t.me/SJCET_MIS_BOT)

This is a Telegram chatbot that fetches PDFs of questions papers that have been asked by the Mumbai University. 

muquestionpapers.com hosts PDFs for most if not all previously asked question papers for Engineering in Mumbai University. The bot scrapes this website and sends the PDFs to the user directly on the Telegram app using the Telgram Bot API. 

Created this as a side-project to avoid opening a website and going through the steps everytime I wish to find a question paper. 

The bot is hosted online on Heroku.
